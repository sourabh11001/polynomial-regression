# Polynomial Regression using Python

This project demonstrates how **Polynomial Regression** can be used to model and predict non-linear relationships between variables. Unlike simple and multiple linear regression, polynomial regression captures the curve in data, making it ideal for datasets where the relationship is not perfectly linear.

---

## 🔍 Objective

To understand how higher-degree polynomial features can improve prediction accuracy for non-linear datasets and visualize how the regression curve fits the data.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

* **Python**
* **NumPy** and **Pandas** – for data preprocessing and manipulation
* **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** – for visualization and curve plotting
* **Scikit-learn** – for creating polynomial features, training the model, and evaluating performance

## 📊 Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Exploration** – Import and inspect the dataset
2. **Visualization** – Plot the data to identify non-linear trends
3. **Feature Transformation** – Generate polynomial features using Scikit-learn
4. **Model Training** – Fit the polynomial regression model
5. **Prediction** – Use the trained model to make predictions
6. **Evaluation** – Compare performance with linear regression using R² and error metrics
7. **Visualization** – Display regression curve overlaying the actual data points

## 📈 Results

The polynomial regression model accurately captures the non-linear relationship between the variables.
Example output: a **smooth curve** fitting the data points better than a straight regression line.
